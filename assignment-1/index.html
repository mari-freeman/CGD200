      <p>My name is <strong>Mari Freeman Albert Riza</strong>. However, I am fondly addressed by friends and colleagues as <strong>Freeman</strong>. I was born and raised in <strong>Taguig City, Metro Manila, Philippines</strong>. I graduated and received my <strong>Bachelor's degree in Food Science and Technology</strong> in 2004 from the <strong>University of Santo Tomas</strong> in <strong>España, Manila</strong>.</p>

      <p>After successfully earning my degree, eager to prove my independence and fulfil the urge to be in a new environment, I decided to move to <strong>Singapore</strong>, where I spent fifteen wonderful years. During my time there, I worked for the <strong>Singapore Golf Association</strong> as an <strong>Operations Manager</strong>. Aside from making sure that the daily operations of the Association are seamless, I oversee and organize national and international amateur golf tournaments hosted by Singapore.</p>

      <p>I am a <em>wanderer at heart</em>. You can find me partying in <strong>Amsterdam</strong> or enjoying the serene <strong>Bali</strong> atmosphere. If it is a country with mouth-watering food, enriching culture, and welcoming people, I am definitely there.</p>

      <p>When I am not traveling, I enjoy relaxing in my room, catching up on movies and TV series, or binge-watching <strong>F.R.I.E.N.D.S.</strong> for what feels like the hundredth time. 
        <span class="quirk">That's me, heavily caffeinated, wandering because I'm wondering!</span>
